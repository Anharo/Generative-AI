## 📘 About This Repository

In this repository, I have posted the codes that I studied and practiced during my course **Generative AI for Application Building [CSU2220]**.

These files include my hands-on experiments, learning notebooks, and implementation practice of core Generative AI concepts.  
From basic RNN models to advanced Transformer architectures, this repo represents my learning journey throughout the course.
