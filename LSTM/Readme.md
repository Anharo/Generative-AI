## 🧠 About the Files in the LSTM Folder

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks and scripts related to **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.  
Here, I practiced and learned how LSTM models work and how they improve over traditional RNNs by handling long-term dependencies more effectively.

### 📄 Files Included

### ** `LSTM_Text_Generation.ipynb`**  
This notebook contains a complete implementation of **LSTM-based text generation**.  
Inside this file, I learned:

- How to prepare text for sequence modeling  
- How to create input sequences and next-token labels  
- How the LSTM layer captures long-term patterns  
- How to train a language-style text generator  
- How to generate text using a trained LSTM model  

This notebook shows the foundations of how models like early GPT and text generators were built.
