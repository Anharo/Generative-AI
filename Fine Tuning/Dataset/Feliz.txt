Propeno: “Hey, mister. You waking up or should I throw you out?”
Toppo (kissing his pillow, mumbling): “Do…n’t… go… ple…ase…”
Propeno pulled her sleeves up.
And then- BAM!
Toppo finally woke up. “Why did you… 😭”
Propeno: “You’re already late. No food for you today. Go straight to school.”
Toppo: “That’s… not fair…😢”
Propeno: “I packed your bag. Get ready.”
Toppo: “Ahh… okay…” (muttering) “Mom really needs to chill…😩”
Propeno: “Did I hear something?”
Toppo: “…Uhh, no?”
She hit him again.
Toppo: “AAHHHH! (T_T)”

Toppo was running for his life, tie flapping, hair a total mess.
As he turned a corner—BAM!
He crashed straight into someone.
Toppo: “Hey, are you alright? You should watch where you’re going!” 😤
Then he noticed—
Same school uniform.
His face changed instantly.
Toppo: “Wait… you’re late too? Nice! :D”
But the girl just pushed him away without a word and kept running toward the school.
Toppo: “Oi! DON’T IGNORE ME!”
Without thinking, he started running right behind her.
Now it was pure chaos.
•	She ran faster.
•	He ran faster too.
Toppo (yelling): “Hey! Wait! I just wanna talk!”
Girl (in her head): Why is he chasing me?!
Toppo, still clueless, was actually smiling as he ran.
Toppo: “Yo, we’re both late! Let’s suffer together!”
She glanced back, panicked, and sped up even more.
Toppo: “W-Whoa! She’s fast! 😳”
By the time they reached the school gates, they both exhausted, completely out of breath.
The girl didn’t even look at him. She just ran straight into the building.
Toppo (kneeling, gasping): “What the…? She didn’t even say anything… Weird…”
Then he sighed.
Toppo (muttering): “Guess I should apologize next time… it was my fault anyway… 😓”
Then he looked at the time on his watch… and smirked.
Toppo: “But hey, at least I made it on time! 😎 She should thank me for this 💪.”
He stood up proudly like he’d just accomplished something heroic…
…even though he had no idea what just happened.
As Toppo entered the classroom, he spotted his friend Crawos, who was staring at him like he’d just seen a ghost.
Crawos (rubbing his eyes dramatically): “No way… no way, bro. 😧 I can’t believe my eyes… Is this the end of the world?”
Toppo (dropping into the seat next to him): “What are you even talking about, bro?”
Crawos: “There’s no freaking way you’re actually on time for school. The last time you came early was when you tried asking out Fressia… and got humiliated so badly you didn’t show up for a week.”
Toppo (facepalming): “Bro, you really didn’t have to bring that up right now. 😒”
Crawos: “So? What happened? Why the miracle today?”
Toppo: “It’s just because I bumped into some girl on the way. She didn’t even say sorry and just ran. I wanted to beat her ass for that but she was fast as hell… BUT—hey, I still made it to class on time! God’s definitely with me. 😁”
Crawos leaned back in his chair, smirking.
Crawos: “So let me get this straight… you’re on time today because you body-slammed some random girl?”
Toppo: “Bruh, it wasn’t like that! She came outta nowhere! And besides, she didn’t even say sorry!”
Crawos: “Ohhh, I get it now…” (leans closer with a sly grin) “…you’re already falling for her, aren’t you?”
Toppo: “HUH?! Bro, what?! I don’t even know her face properly!”
Crawos: “Yeah, yeah. That’s how it starts. First it’s just an ‘accident.’ Next thing you know, you’re writing cringe love letters again.”
Toppo: “AGAIN?! Bro, that was ONE TIME!”
Crawos: “One time that made you the school meme for an entire month.”
Toppo (clutching his head): “I told you NEVER to bring that up again…” 😭
Crawos: “I’m just saying, man… history has a way of repeating itself. Maybe she’s your fate. Or your next humiliation.”
Toppo: “Shut up, dude. She was just… weird. Didn’t even talk. Total weirdo.”
Crawos: “Mhm, sure. That’s exactly what you said about Fressia too…”
Toppo: “…I hate you.” 😒
Crawos: “Love you too, buddy.” 😏
Soon the teacher walked in, holding a stack of papers.
Teacher: “What in the actual ****…??” (points straight at Toppo) “There is NO WAY you’re on time. Not on this earth. Not in this lifetime.”
Toppo: 😭😭 “Siiirr… why do you say that like it’s impossible?”
Teacher: “Anyway, doesn’t matter. Get up. Go stand outside as punishment.” 🙂
Toppo: 😀 “Wait, WHAT?!”
Teacher: “Don’t play dumb with me. I heard you were following our new transfer student to school. Ruining her first day already?!” 🤨
Crawos: (whispering) “Bro… you’re dead now. 😁”
Toppo (in his head): 🥲 I’m cooked fr.
Teacher: “Come in, Soras.”
The classroom went quiet as the new girl stepped in.
Every single pair of eyes followed her.
Someone whispered: “Whoa… she’s really cute.”
Another guy smirked: “I’m definitely talking to her later. Bonus points thanks to that crazy idiot Toppo scaring her first.”
Toppo just sat there frozen, realizing—
Toppo (in his head): …wait. HER?! 
Earlier he didn’t really see her face when they bumped into each other…
but now, looking at her under the classroom light—
Toppo (in his head): She’s… really cute… 😳
The teacher slammed the papers on the desk.
Teacher: “Hey! Are you even listening, Toppo?”
Toppo (barely audible): “Of course… she’s cute… 🥲”
Teacher: “What are you whispering with Crawos? Huh, Crawos?”
Crawos: “What?! No, not me!”
Toppo: “Sir, it’s all a misunderstanding—”
Before he could finish, Soras turned her head and spoke calmly.
Soras: “Yes… yes, sir. It was him. The one with the weird hair and untucked tie hanging.”
Toppo (in his head): WTF is wrong with her?! 😭
Teacher: “Either you come and say sorry to her, or you’re standing outside all day.”
Toppo: “But sir, it was all a mist—”
Teacher: “Shut up. Come forward and apologize.”
Toppo froze.
Walk up to her? Say sorry? In front of the entire class?! That would destroy his reputation.
But… standing outside all day? 😢
All eyes were on him.
Crawos tried to look away, but was secretly clicking pictures under the desk.
Toppo (in his head): You son of a… I’ll deal with you later!
He swallowed, trying to look into her eyes.
Toppo: “I… I am—”
Birds were chirping softly.
The sun shone gently through the school windows.
And there was Toppo, standing outside the classroom with his hands raised above his head, face full of regret. 😭
Students passing by whispered and giggled.
A first-year even pointed and said, “Is that guy being punished on the first period?”
Toppo just stared blankly at the sky.
Toppo (in his head): This… this is hell.
The first class finally ended.
The door slid open and the teacher called out casually,
Teacher: “Toppo, you can come back in now.”
Toppo slowly lowered his aching arms and shuffled back into the room like a defeated soldier.
Crawos leaned over with the widest grin.
Crawos (whispering): “Bro… I got so many good pictures. Meme material for weeks. 😁”
Toppo (in his head): …I’m gonna kill him after class.
He sat down, avoiding everyone’s eyes.
Meanwhile, Soras didn’t even glance at him once. She just kept staring out the window, completely silent.
Toppo sneaked a look at her profile… and for a moment, he couldn’t help but think—
Toppo (in his head): Why… does she look so sad?
The second class ended without anything unusual.
But the whole time, Toppo couldn’t stop glancing at her.
And at one point, Soras actually noticed. Their eyes met for a split second before she looked away again, her face unreadable.
When the bell rang for break, Toppo slumped back in his chair.
He and Crawos stepped out into the hallway, grabbing drinks from the vending machine.
Toppo: “Hey, bro… didn’t you notice something… different about her?”
Crawos (taking a sip from his juice can): “Huh? What are you talking about?”
Toppo: “I mean… did I do something that bad? Like, yeah, I was late and bumped into her but…”
Crawos: “What?”
Toppo: “I mean… I should be the one feeling awkward, right? So why does she… look so sad?”
Crawos: “Maybe it’s just her first day. New school, new faces. It happens.”
Toppo: “…Maybe.”
Crawos: “Don’t overthink it, bro. We’ll talk to her later during lunch. But for now, let’s leave her alone before she really starts thinking you’re some kind of villain or stalker.”
Toppo: “…Yeah, you’re probably right.”
They both finished their drinks and leaned against the wall, just chilling in silence for a moment.
Times Passed normally.
Finally it was Lunch break.
Toppo stood in the cafeteria line, holding his tray nervously. Crawos was right behind him.
Crawos: “Alright, bro. This is your chance. Just go over there, say hi, and sit with her. Easy.”
Toppo: “Y-Yeah… easy…” (internal panic intensifies)
He spotted Soras sitting alone by the window, quietly eating.
Toppo (in his head): Okay… just don’t mess this up. You just walk, smile, and say hi. That’s it. Even YOU can’t screw this up.
With shaky hands, he started walking toward her.
________________________________________
But then… someone bumped into him.
The tray tilted.
His lunch—rice, curry, juice—flew straight onto Soras.
SPLAAAT.
The entire cafeteria went silent.
Soras slowly looked up, her uniform dripping with curry.
Toppo just stood there frozen, holding the now-empty tray.
Toppo: “…oh… no…” 😨
The whispers started immediately.
“Did you see that?!”
“That’s the second time today he’s messed with her!”
“Bro’s got some nerve bullying the new girl already…”
Crawos, still behind him, just facepalmed.
Crawos (muttering): “He’s so dead…” 😬
Toppo wanted to say something—anything—but his brain just blanked.
Toppo panicked.
Toppo: “I—I’m so sorry!! Hold on—!”
Without thinking, he grabbed his handkerchief and started wiping Soras’s face.
She just stared at him blankly, still dripping with curry.
But then… Toppo’s nervous hands moved down to her chest without realizing.
The entire cafeteria gasped.
Crawos, standing a few steps away, nearly choked on his drink.
Crawos: “BRO. BRO, STOP. YOU’RE GONNA GET EXPELLED FR!” 😱
Someone else shouted:
“Is he SERIOUSLY harassing the new girl on her first day?!”
The whispers turned into a storm.
“Wow, what a creep…”
“Didn’t he chase her this morning too?”
“Somebody call the teacher!”
Toppo finally realized where his hand was and froze in horror.
Toppo (in his head): …oh no… ohhhh no no no no… 😨
He stepped back so fast he almost tripped over his own feet.
Toppo: “WAIT—IT’S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!!!”
But Soras just stood up silently, not saying a word, and walked out of the cafeteria… leaving a stunned, curry-covered trail behind.
Toppo stood frozen in the cafeteria, waiting for the inevitable.
She’s going to the teacher.
She’s definitely going to tell on him.
He was already imagining the principal’s office, expulsion papers, and his mom beating him to death.
But…
She didn’t.
Soras just quietly left without a single word.
________________________________________
CUT TO:
After lunch break, Toppo slowly walked back to the classroom.
And there she was—
Soras was already sitting by the window, still in her slightly damp, curry-stained uniform, silently looking outside.
The class was empty. No one else had come in yet.
Toppo hesitated for a moment, then walked toward her.
Toppo: “I… I’m really sorry about earlier…”
She didn’t turn, didn’t answer.
Toppo scratched his head awkwardly, panicking inside.
Then—suddenly—he pulled off his own shirt and held it out to her.
Toppo: “Here. You can… put this on instead. It’s clean… well, clean-ish…”
For the first time, Soras slowly turned her head to look at him.
Her eyes were calm, but there was something heavy behind them.
Toppo awkwardly smiled, holding out his shirt like an idiot.
Soras slowly turned her head—
—only to see Toppo standing there half-naked, holding out his shirt.
Her calm expression instantly cracked.
Her eyes widened. A faint blush flashed across her face before she immediately stood up.
Soras: “…!”
Without saying a word, she quickly rushed out of the classroom, heading straight for the washroom.
Toppo just stood there frozen, still shirtless.
Toppo (in his head): …wait… did I just… make it worse? 😨
At that exact moment, Crawos walked into the room, took one look at the situation—Toppo shirtless, the girl gone—and sighed.
Crawos: “Bro… WHY are you like this?”
Toppo: “I… I was just trying to help…” 😭
Toppo sat stiffly in his seat, still sweating bullets even after putting his shirt back on. Crawos leaned casually on the desk next to him, sipping juice like nothing ever bothered him.
Crawos: “Bro, you’re dead. 100%.”
Toppo: “Bro, don’t say that! My heart’s already going ba-dum ba-dum like it’s about to explode… 🥲”
Crawos: “Then maybe it’s time you grow up? You’re sixteen, man. Most people develop a brain by now, but you—”
Toppo: “😭”
Before Toppo could argue, Crawos suddenly nudged him.
Crawos: “Shh, teacher’s here.”
The classroom instantly stood up.
“Good morning, sensei!”
Toppo half-mumbled the greeting, his eyes darting toward the door. Where is she?
A few minutes later, the door finally slid open.
Soras walked in.
No words. No glances at anyone. She just quietly moved to her seat by the window, her expression calm and unreadable.
Toppo froze. She… didn’t say anything. She didn’t even look at me. That means…
He leaned closer to Crawos and whispered, voice full of nervous hope:
Toppo: “Bro… I think I’m not that cooked…”
Crawos: shrugs “Seems so. But don’t get happy yet. You better say sorry to her after school. Properly. No shirt nonsense this time.”
Toppo: “Yeah… yeah, for sure. 🫡🫡”
________________________________________
The rest of the class went by normally. The teacher droned on, people passed notes, someone in the back fell asleep.
But for Toppo, nothing felt normal.
Every few minutes, his eyes flicked toward Soras. She sat there quietly, chin resting on her hand, looking out the window like she was somewhere far away.
Time passed fast.
The bell finally rang. Students started packing their bags, chatting, and heading out.
Toppo was still glued to his seat, clutching his bag like it was a lifeline.
Crawos: “Well? This is it, bro. Time to clear the air.”
Toppo: “Y-Yeah… I’ll just… I’ll just wait until everyone’s gone so it’s less awkward.”
Crawos: “Or you could just stop being a coward and go now.”
Toppo: “Bro, let me mentally prepare at least 5 minutes!”
Crawos just rolled his eyes and slung his bag over his shoulder.
Crawos: “Fine, I’ll wait by the gates. If you don’t come out in 10 minutes, I’m leaving you to die alone.”
Toppo: “Wow, thanks for the emotional support, best friend.” 😒
Crawos left with a lazy wave.
________________________________________
The classroom grew quieter as students left one by one.
Until it was just… Toppo and Soras.
She was still sitting there, slowly closing her books and arranging her things, completely calm like the morning never happened.
Toppo took a deep breath. Okay… it’s just a normal apology. Just say “sorry” and walk away. Easy.
He stood up. Walked over to her desk. His legs felt like jelly.
Soras looked up slowly, her eyes meeting his.
Toppo froze. Oh crap, she’s looking right at me!
But he forced himself to speak.
Toppo: “I… uh… about today… and earlier… I… I’m really sorry.”
There was a long pause.
Soras just stared at him for a moment, unreadable.
Then she calmly said—
Soras: “…You’re strange.”
Toppo blinked.
Toppo: “Huh?!”
Soras: “You didn’t mean to… but you keep making things worse.”
Toppo: “I—I know! I didn’t mean to spill the curry, and I definitely didn’t mean to—uh—you know… accidentally…” he gestured vaguely toward her chest and immediately regretted it 😨
She tilted her head slightly.
Soras: “…Then why are you apologizing now?”
Toppo opened his mouth. Closed it again. He had no idea how to answer that.
Before he could figure it out, Soras quietly stood up, slung her bag over her shoulder, and walked past him toward the door.
But just as she reached the door—
She stopped.
Without turning around, she said softly:
Soras: “…Thanks.”
Then she left.
________________________________________
Toppo stood there, blinking.
Toppo (in his head): …Wait. Did she just thank me? For what?! 😳
Crawos suddenly popped his head in from the hallway.
Crawos: “Yo, you alive? Or did she slap you into next week?”
Toppo: “She… she just… thanked me?”
Crawos: “Huh? For spilling curry on her? Bro, are you sure you’re not hallucinating from stress?”
Toppo: “…I… I don’t get her at all.”
They started walking toward home.
Crawos: “Hey, you’re buying me ice cream for helping you today, right?”
Toppo: “Why would I? 🤨”
Crawos: smirks “Ask yourself again. You sure you don’t owe me?”
Toppo: “…Bruh. Alright. Ngl, you actually give good advice sometimes…”
Crawos: “Exactly. Whatever—my ice cream is more important than your pride. 🥰”
Toppo: “😩”
Meanwhile, at Soras’ house.
She stepped inside quietly.
Her mom, Miyako, came to greet her at the door. She took Soras’ bag, but immediately noticed the curry stains on her uniform.
Miyako: “Hey, sweetie… what happened to your clothes? Did someone… bully you?”
Soras paused for a moment, then shook her head.
Soras: “…No. It was an accident.”
Miyako frowned slightly, but didn’t press further. She just sighed and smiled softly.
Miyako: “Alright. Go get changed before dinner, okay?”
Soras: “…Okay.”
________________________________________
In her room, Soras hung her stained uniform and sat by the window. The sky outside was painted in soft orange as the sun set.
For a moment, she just stared quietly… then, almost unconsciously, a tiny smile tugged at the corner of her lips.
Soras (whispering):
“…Strange boy.”
And just like that, she looked away from the window, her expression returning to its usual calm.
________________________________________
Across town, Toppo and Crawos sat on a bench, happily eating ice cream.
Crawos: “See? Not a bad day after all.”
Toppo: still in disbelief “She… she thanked me, bro. I still don’t get it…”
Crawos: “Don’t think too hard. Just don’t mess up tomorrow.”
Toppo: “…Yeah.”
The two sat in peaceful silence as the day slowly faded into night.
________________________________________
End of Day 1.

*WHY ALWAYS MEEEE*
Next morning, Toppo was sleeping like a horse—mouth open, drooling, snoring like a broken engine.
Propeno: “TOOOPPPOOOOOOO!”
Meanwhile, in dreamland—
Toppo (dreaming): “Let’s gooo! I’m about to beat the final boss! Toppo the heavenly god! 😎”
Back in reality, Propeno’s voice echoed through the house.
Propeno: “If you’re not downstairs in five minutes, I’m throwing YOU and your entire game collection OUT!”
Still dreaming, Toppo was running toward a giant glowing gate.
Toppo (dreaming): “Just a little more… victory is mine…”
But then reality hit.
The door creaked open slowly.
Propeno: “…I’m sick of this boy.”
She poked him. No reaction. She shook him. Still no reaction.
Toppo (still asleep): “Huh… why’s the ground shaking… is it an earthquake boss?”
Propeno: “Oh, so you’re not waking up, huh?” 😈
She calmly walked to the bathroom, filled a cup of water, came back like a silent assassin.
Propeno: “LAST chance, mister…”
Toppo (still in dream): “Finally… the FINAL BOSS awaits…”
Propeno: “1… 2… 3…”
SPLAAAASHHH!! 💦
Toppo: “WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO—” 💀💀
He shot up like a spring.
“WHY DID YOU DO THATTTT?!” 😭😭
Propeno (pointing at the clock): “Look at the TIME, mister!”
Toppo (whispering): “Time my ass… I was THIS close to seeing the final boss…” 😒
Propeno: “…What did you just say?”
Before he could escape—YANK. She grabbed his ears like handles.
Toppo: “AAAAAHHH IT HURTSSSS!! SORRYYYY!! 😫😫”
Toppo stumbled out of bed, one ear still red from the “Propeno punishment.”
He threw on his uniform in pure panic mode—shirt half buttoned, tie dangling like a dead snake.
Then he grabbed his bag, a random piece of bread, and bolted.
Propeno (yelling from the kitchen):
“NO BREAKFAST FOR YOU TODAY! LEARN TO WAKE UP LIKE A NORMAL HUMAN!”
Toppo (muttering with bread in his mouth):
“Normal human… she says… 😩”
Toppo finally dashed out of the house like a man escaping a war zone, bread in his mouth, tie half hanging off.
Toppo (panting):
“I’m… so… dead…”
Toppo (in his head):
“I’m late again! WHY does this keep happening?! If I fail attendance, Mom’s gonna turn into the REAL final boss!”
He skidded around a corner, almost tripping over a cat.
Toppo:
“SORRY, CAT!”
As he sprinted toward the school, he spotted Crawos casually leaning against a wall near the corner, sipping a juice box like he had all the time in the world.
Toppo:
“BRO?! What are you doing here?! You’re late too?!”
Crawos (raising an eyebrow):
“Late? Nah. I’ve been waiting for YOU, genius.”
Toppo:
“Huh? WHY would you wait?!”
Crawos (shrugs):
“’Cause I knew you’d oversleep. Again. And I didn’t want to hear you crying about walking in alone. You’re welcome.”
Toppo (teary-eyed):
“Bro… you’re a real one…”
Crawos (coldly):
“…Also, you owe me ice cream for this.”
Toppo:
“My money 🫠”
________________________________________
They both started jogging toward the school.
Crawos:
“So? What’s your excuse today? Fighting the final boss in your dreams again?”
Toppo:
“YES! I was THIS close! And then… BAM. Mom’s ultimate move—‘WATER SPLASH OF DOOM.’”
Crawos:
“Pfft—so she got you again? Man, you’re hopeless.”
Toppo:
“Bro… I think she enjoys it.” 😭
They reached the gates just before the bell. Crawos walked in casually, totally calm, while Toppo collapsed like he’d just run a marathon.
Inside the classroom, the teacher had just started taking attendance.
Crawos:
“See? I told you. You made it.”
Toppo:
“Yeah…  😵”
The morning classes dragged on until the period just before lunch. The History teacher strolled in, looking unusually cheerful (which was always a bad sign).
History Teacher (smirking):
“Alright, class… I have good news.”
Everyone instantly tensed. Good news from him was NEVER actually good.
Toppo (whispering to Crawos):
“Bro… he’s smiling like a villain. This can’t be good…”
Crawos (deadpan):
“Brace yourself, bro. You know what’s coming.”
________________________________________
The teacher clapped his hands.
History Teacher:
“After lunch, we’ll have a QUIZ on everything we’ve covered so far!”
The entire class groaned in unison.
History Teacher (ignoring them):
“So you’d better eat well and be READY. No excuses!”
Then his eyes locked on Toppo.
History Teacher:
“Especially YOU, Toppo.”
Toppo sat up, instantly offended.
Toppo:
“Wha—WHY ME?! What did I do?!”
History Teacher (with a cold glare):
“You? Exist. And considering you failed the last three quizzes spectacularly, I’m making sure you don’t bring down the class average this time.”
The whole class oohed.
Toppo:
“😭 Sir, you’re treating me like I’m some kind of national threat…”
History Teacher:
“You’re worse. At least a dictator destroys countries. YOU destroy my hope as an educator.”
Toppo (clutching his chest):
“Bro… he really compared me to a dictator. A WHOLE dictator. 💔”
Crawos (trying not to laugh):
“Hey, at least you’re finally important for once.”
Toppo:
“Shut up!”
________________________________________
History Teacher:
“Anyway, eat your lunch. Study. And don’t even think about slacking off. I’ll personally make sure SOMEONE doesn’t escape this time…”
Again, his finger stabbed in Toppo’s direction.
Toppo (muttering):
“…I’m telling you, this guy has a personal vendetta against me.”
Crawos:
“Maybe he just hates clowns, bro.”
Toppo:
“😩”
________________________________________
The bell for lunch finally rang.
Students stood up, already groaning about the upcoming quiz.
Toppo, instead of moving, just stayed frozen in his seat… staring.
His eyes were locked on Soras.
She was calmly flipping through a tiny notebook, her expression unreadable. While everyone else panicked or whined about the quiz, she looked like it was just another ordinary day.
Toppo tilted his head slightly.
Toppo (in his head):
She’s… way too calm. Like, is she secretly a genius? Or does she just not care?
He kept staring.
Like… really staring.
So much that Crawos elbowed him.
Crawos:
“Bro, you’re staring like a creep again. Chill.”
Toppo (whispering):
“I’m not creeping! I’m just… observing. It’s… research.”
Crawos:
“Yeah, tell that to the cops later.”
But before Toppo could respond, Soras finally lifted her head.
Their eyes met.
Toppo froze like a deer in headlights.
She tilted her head slightly, a hint of confusion in her calm eyes.
Soras (softly):
“Do you… ne…eed something?”
Toppo blinked, completely caught off guard.
Toppo:
“Uh… yeah. I mean—NO! I mean… I was just wondering…”
He blurted the first thing that came to his brain.
Toppo:
“Don’t you fear the teacher? Or are you like… some kind of topper from your last school??”
The entire room went silent for a second.
Crawos facepalmed so hard it echoed.
Crawos:
“Bro. What… WHAT kind of question is that?!”
Soras just blinked at him, clearly unsure how to even respond.
Finally, she said in the calmest voice possible:
Soras:
“…No. I’m just used to studying.”
Then she packed her notebook quietly and stood up to leave for lunch without another word.
Toppo just sat there, still processing how awkward that was.
Crawos:
“Smooth, bro. Real smooth. I’m sure she’s totally impressed now.”
Toppo:
“😭 I panicked, okay?!”
Crawos:
“Bruh… you’ll never change, will you?”
Toppo:
🧐
Toppo lets out the most dramatic sigh imaginable and just gets up like a defeated old man, trudging toward the cafeteria.
Toppo slumped over his desk, face buried in his arms.
Toppo:
“…I can’t believe I actually said that. ‘Are you some kind of topper’?! 😭”
Crawos:
“Yup. That was next-level cringe, bro. Peak dumb.”
Toppo:
“Bro, you’re supposed to console me, not roast me!”
Crawos:
“Nah. You don’t need comfort. You need a brain replacement.”
Before Toppo could argue, Crawos grabbed his arm.
Crawos:
“C’mon. Let’s get lunch before you embarrass yourself even more.”
They headed to the cafeteria.
And instantly—CHAOS.
Students yelling, trays clattering, tables completely full, the lunch lady screaming at someone for trying to cut in line.
Toppo (staring at the madness):
“…Yeah, nope. I’m out.”
He tried to turn back, but Crawos shoved him forward.
Crawos:
“Nope. You’re facing the battlefield today. Go!”
They squeezed into the line, somehow surviving the pushing crowd. But just as Toppo took his tray…
TRIP!
He stepped on someone’s bag, fell forward, and his entire lunch—rice, curry, juice—went SPLAAAAT across the floor.
A collective gasp.
And standing right there, her pristine shoes now splattered with curry—
Chio.
The class topper. Miss Perfect. Aura of “I’m already in the top university while you’re still learning the alphabet.”
She turned her head slowly, her calm but deadly eyes locking onto him.
Chio (flat voice):
“…Toppo.”
Toppo froze.
Toppo (sweating bullets):
“Uh… hey… hehe?”
Chio:
“Do you ever exist without being a walking disaster?”
Toppo:
“…Sometimes?”
She sighed. Adjusted her glasses. Looked at him like he was a bug under a microscope.
Chio:
“Pathetic.”
And then—ignoring the entire mess—she stepped gracefully around the curry, grabbed her lunch tray like nothing happened, and walked off like a queen.
Toppo just stood there, blinking.
Toppo:
“…She didn’t even insult me properly. Just ‘pathetic’??”
Crawos was laughing so hard he almost dropped his tray.
Crawos:
“BROOO you just got DEMOLISHED by ONE word. ONE WORD! 🤣”
The lunch lady glared at Toppo like he was a war criminal.
Lunch Lady:
“YOU! OUT! No more trays for you! You’re banned!”
Toppo stumbled out of the line, holding absolutely nothing.
Toppo:
“😭😭 WHY DOES THE UNIVERSE HATE ME?!”
Crawos followed him out, munching on a sandwich like nothing happened.
They sat at an empty table. Crawos happily opened his lunch while Toppo sulked, arms crossed.
Crawos (mocking):
“Want a bite? Oh wait, no, you’re banned from food now. Baby Toppo gets nothing.”
Toppo:
“Bro, you’re literally the worst friend…” 😭
Crawos was about to say something else, but then—
A shadow fell over their table.
Toppo looked up.
It was Soras.
She stood there silently for a moment, holding her own bento box.
Then, without a word, she placed it gently on the table in front of him.
Soras:
“…You can eat this.”
Toppo blinked.
Toppo:
“Wait… huh? But… this is yours.”
Soras (calmly):
“You’re hungry, right? It’s fine. I’m not that hungry today.”
Toppo just stared, completely stunned.
Crawos froze too, mid-bite.
Crawos (whispering):
“Bro… did… did an angel just descend from heaven?!”
Toppo scrambled to say something, ANYTHING.
Toppo:
“I-I… uh… thanks… I guess…”
Soras simply nodded slightly and turned to leave.
She didn’t even wait for him to respond properly—just walked away, back toward her usual window seat.
Toppo looked down at the neat little bento box in disbelief.
Crawos leaned in, smirking.
Crawos:
“…You lucky idiot. You don’t deserve this kindness.”
Toppo, still staring at the lunch:
Toppo (softly):
“…She’s… really weird. But… kinda nice weird.”
Toppo stared at the neatly packed bento box like it was a holy artifact.
Crawos:
“Bro… are you just gonna look at it, or eat it?”
Toppo (serious):
“This… this is different. This is not just food. This is… kindness itself.”
Crawos:
“Bruh, it’s literally rice and veggies.”
But Toppo ignored him. He picked up a piece with the chopsticks, hesitated dramatically… and took a bite.
And then—
Toppo (eyes widening):
“…holy…”
A warm, glowing aura literally seemed to radiate from him.
Toppo:
“This… this is the taste of… HEAVEN!”
He dropped his chopsticks, clasped his hands together like he was praying.
Toppo (tearing up):
“I can taste the effort… the love… the care… every grain of rice… PERFECT…”
Crawos just stared.
Crawos:
“…Are you seriously having a food orgasm right now?”
But Toppo was gone. He was in another dimension.
He took another bite and leaned back dramatically, eyes rolling like some fancy food critic.
Toppo:
“Mmmm… even the side dishes… so balanced… so delicate… This isn’t just lunch, Crawos. This is a MASTERPIECE!”
Crawos facepalmed.
Crawos:
“Bro… you’re literally acting like you just discovered the meaning of life.”
Toppo suddenly grinned like a villain. He turned toward Crawos, holding up a perfect little bite of Soras’s homemade lunch.
Toppo:
“Hey Crawos… how’s your cafeteria sludge tasting? Hm?” 😏
Crawos froze mid-bite, glaring.
Crawos:
“…don’t you dare.”
But Toppo was already on full flex mode.
Toppo (mocking):
“Aww, look at you… eating that sad, oily café curry. Meanwhile, I—” (takes another slow, exaggerated bite) “—am dining on freshly made HOME-COOKED PERFECTION!”
He literally stood up from his seat and posed like a king.
Toppo:
“BEHOLD! Home-cooked lunch… offered to me by an angel herself!”
People nearby started staring, whispering.
“Is that guy okay?”
“Wait… is that Toppo? How did he get a girl’s homemade lunch?!”
Crawos groaned, slamming his head on the table.
Crawos:
“I’m gonna punch you in the face.”
Toppo ignored him completely, savoring every bite like he was at a 5-star restaurant.
Toppo (dramatic):
“Ahh… Crawos, my dear peasant… would you like a taste of this divine blessing?”
Crawos:
“…Touch me and die.”
Toppo laughed like an evil overlord.
Toppo:
“Hahaha! No, this treasure is MINE. All mine!”
Meanwhile, at the other end of the cafeteria, Soras glanced back once. She saw him… acting like an absolute idiot.
Her calm face twitched—just a tiny bit—before she turned back to her book, pretending not to know him.
Toppo was still in his dramatic “food heaven” mode, finishing the last bite with a blissful sigh.
Toppo:
“Ahhh… that was… chef’s kiss. Truly, the meal of kings…”
Crawos just stared at him like he was looking at a lunatic.
Crawos:
“You done with your performance, Gordon Ramsay? Or you gonna roll on the floor too?”
Toppo wiped his mouth with Soras’s neatly folded napkin like he was at some 5-star restaurant.
Toppo (smirking):
“Bro, admit it… you’re jealous. You’re eating this cheap cafeteria mush, and I just had home-cooked masterpiece.”
Crawos raised an eyebrow.
Crawos:
“Yeah, sure. But now you gotta give that lunchbox back.”
Toppo suddenly froze mid-smug.
Toppo:
“…wait… I have to face her… again?!”
Crawos grinned like a devil.
Crawos:
“Oh yeah. March up to her like a good boy and give it back. Let’s see if you can survive without tripping over your own tongue.”
Nearby students were already whispering.
“Did Soras really give him her lunch?”
“Wait, does that mean they’re close?!”
“No way. Soras and Toppo?!”
Toppo’s panic doubled.
Toppo (whispering):
“Bro, people are staring! They’re getting the WRONG idea!”
Crawos:
“They’re getting the fun idea. Don’t ruin it for me.”
Before Toppo could protest, Crawos grabbed him by the collar and shoved him gently toward Soras, who was quietly sitting by the window finishing her drink.
Toppo, clutching the empty lunchbox like it was a cursed artifact, slowly walked over.
Toppo (awkwardly):
“Uh… h-here… thank you for the lunch… it was… really good.”
Soras looked up at him calmly, then gave a small nod.
Soras:
“…I’m glad you liked it.”
She took the box from his hands without any hint of emotion and neatly placed it back in her bag.
Toppo just stood there frozen, unsure if he should say more or run away.
Finally, she looked at him again and spoke softly.
Soras:
“You… are really awkward.”
And with that, she stood up and walked out of the cafeteria, leaving Toppo frozen mid-bite, blinking like a stunned goldfish.
Crawos was already gone, cry-laughing into his sleeve.
Crawos:
“BAHAHA—BRO! She just ended your whole career with ONE word!”
Toppo: 😭😭 “Awkward?! I… I’m not awkward!!”
But deep down… he knew she was right.
The lunch bell rang, signaling the end of break. Students started heading back to class while Toppo dragged himself back like a defeated NPC.
All the students sat frozen in their seats, fear written all over their faces.
Only Soras and Chio looked completely chill—like this was just another boring day.
Toppo, who was scared of Soras a moment ago, was now trembling for a different reason—the quiz.
Toppo (whispering nervously):
“Bro… this quiz is gonna be hard, right?”
Crawos (smirking):
“Not harder than me on a Sunday morning… 😏”
Toppo: 💀☠️ “BROOO… wrong timing for that!”
Before he could recover, the classroom door creaked open.
Crawos (leaning in, whispering dramatically):
“…Here comes… the Final Boss of today.”
Toppo: 😥 I’m so cooked…
The entire room went silent.
All students stood up stiffly, like soldiers awaiting execution.
Class (murmuring in fear):
“Gooood Afternoon, Sensei…”
The door creaked open.
The teacher walked in calmly, holding a massive history book that looked like it could crush someone’s soul. He dropped it on the desk with a thunderous THUD. Dust flew everywhere.
Teacher (adjusting glasses):
“Alright, students… cough cough Toppo cough… are you ready for today’s quiz?”
Toppo: 🫨🥹 (whispering) “Hey… did you hear that? He literally said my name!”
Crawos (leaning on his desk, completely chill):
“Nope.”
Toppo (panicking in his head):
No… I DEFINITELY heard that… I’M TARGETED. 😨
The teacher lifted the giant history book with one hand like a weapon of mass destruction.
Teacher:
“Today… we’re playing in teams of two.”
The entire class let out a sigh of relief.
Students (collectively):
“Oh thank god…”
But then the teacher’s smile grew darker.
Teacher:
“BUT… the LAST team in ranking will clean the ENTIRE school. And don’t worry—I already told the other classes NOT to clean anything today… because my favorite student is going to handle it.”
His gaze landed on Toppo, piercing through his soul.
Toppo (in his head):
BROOO… HELL NAH. I’M COOKED. 😭
Please… PLEASE… pair me with a nerd. 🙏
The teacher slammed the history book shut with a dramatic BAM.
Teacher:
“Here’s how it works. I’ll ask a total of 16 questions to the WHOLE team. You’ll have 15 seconds to write down your answers.”
Aruo (random kid raising hand):
“Uh, sensei? Then what’s the point of even having a team?”
The teacher gave him a sweet, evil smile.
Teacher:
“Exactly. There is none. 😁”
Class (collective despair):
“…WE’RE ALL COOKED.” 😭
Toppo gulped hard, sneaking a glance at Soras, who was calmly staring out the window like nothing mattered.
Toppo (in his head):
How… HOW can she be so calm even right now?!
The teacher clapped his hands once.
Teacher:
“Alright! I’m calling names in pairs. Move fast—we’ve only got two hours!”
Class:
“Okay, sensei…”
Everyone tensed up as the teacher began reading names from his list…
The teacher squinted at the list like it was some sacred scroll.
Teacher:
“First pair… Hiroshi and Kenji. Move together!”
The two boys exchanged we’re doomed looks and shuffled their seats.
Teacher:
“Next… Mina and Yuka.”
The girls high-fived. Lucky.
Toppo (whispering nervously):
“Bro… what if I get paired with someone worse than me?!”
Crawos (grinning like a devil):
“Relax. No one’s worse than you.” 😏
Toppo: 💀 “BRO!”
The teacher’s finger slid down the list slowly like he was deliberately torturing them.
Teacher:
“Next… Crawos…”
Crawos straightened up like a soldier.
Crawos:
“Yessir.”
Teacher:
“…and Chio.”
The class oooh’d softly.
Chio, the top scorer of the class, looked mildly annoyed but didn’t protest.
Crawos (smirking at Toppo):
“Bro… I just got the class topper. I’m SAVED. Enjoy cleaning toilets.” 😁
Toppo:
“NOOO! Take me with you! Take me with youuuu!” 😭
The teacher ignored his cries and kept reading.
Teacher:
“And finally…”
A tense silence filled the room.
Toppo (in his head):
Please… anyone but the dumbest kid. Please, please, please…
Teacher:
“Toppo…”
Toppo: 😰 “Y-Yes…?”
Teacher:
“…and Soras.”
The entire class gasped.
Random Student:
“No way… the new girl?!”
Soras calmly stood up without even reacting and walked toward Toppo’s seat.
Toppo (internally screaming):
WHAAAT?! 😳
She sat next to him, completely unfazed, her calm aura making him even more nervous.
Meanwhile Crawos, sitting comfortably next to Chio, gave him a thumbs-up with the smuggest grin.
Crawos:
“Bro, you’re paired with your crush. Either you’ll shine… or die.”
Toppo (in his head):
I’M GONNA DIEEEE! 😭😭😭
The teacher slammed the massive history book on the desk again.
Teacher:
“Alright, teams are settled. I’m going to start the quiz now. Remember—16 questions, 15 seconds each. If you don’t write it down, it’s WRONG. Got it?”
Class:
“Yes, sensei…”
Teacher (smirking):
“Good. First question…”
The quiz of DOOM began.
The teacher flipped open his giant history book with a thud that echoed like a death sentence.
Teacher:
“Alright, students. Team quiz begins now. You’ll have 15 seconds per question. Write your answers silently—no talking. Let’s start.”
Team 1 got an easy one:
Teacher:
“Question 1: What year did World War II end?”
They scribbled 1945 instantly. Easy.
Team 2?
Teacher:
“Question 2: Who discovered America?”
Christopher Columbus. Easy again.
Toppo, sitting halfway down the room, started to relax.
Toppo (whispering to Crawos):
“Bro… this is cake. I might actually survive this.”
Crawos:
“Yeah, even you can guess these. Chill.”
As more teams answered, the questions stayed simple.
Teacher:
“What’s the capital of France?”
“Who was the first Shogun of Japan?”
Basic. Smooth. No one failed.
________________________________________
Time passed.
Now, finally—Team Soras & Toppo.
The teacher paused, glanced at his list… then smirked.
Teacher:
“Team Soras… and Toppo.”
Toppo instantly stiffened.
Toppo (in his head):
Bro why did he say my name like that… 😨
The teacher adjusted his glasses, clearly enjoying this.
Teacher:
“Alright. Your first question…”
He read it slowly, like a villain.
Teacher:
“Name all the leaders present at the Yalta Conference of 1945.”
The entire class froze.
Random student:
“HUH?! That’s way harder than ours!”
Toppo’s soul left his body.
Toppo (in his head):
…Yalta what now?!! Is that even in the textbook?! 😭
Meanwhile, Soras calmly wrote: Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin.
Toppo glanced at her paper like she was a goddess descending from heaven.
Toppo (in his head):
HOW DOES SHE KNOW THIS?!
Before he could recover, the teacher hit them with another bomb.
Teacher:
“Second question. Explain the significance of the Treaty of Kanagawa in one sentence.”
Crawos snorted in the back.
Crawos (whispering):
“Bro’s getting cooked alive. 💀”
Toppo clutched his pen in despair.
Toppo (thinking):
Treaty… of what? Kanagawho?!
Meanwhile, Soras’ pen flowed effortlessly:
It opened Japanese ports to American trade in 1854, ending Japan’s isolation.
Toppo peeked again. His face? Pure awe and pain.
Toppo (in his head):
She’s not human. She’s a walking history book.
The teacher, clearly pleased with his evil, moved on like nothing happened.
As time passed…
Other teams got easy stuff again. “When was the Meiji Era?” “What’s the capital of Germany?”
But Toppo just sat there frozen, traumatized, knowing their set was the hardest of the day.
When the quiz ended, he slumped over his desk.
Toppo (whispering):
“Bro… I got, like, maybe two answers. I’m done for.”
Crawos:
“Hey, at least your teammate carried you. Meanwhile I wrote… vibes for one answer.”

After a while when everyone’s turn ended.
The teacher finally closed the giant history book with a loud thud.
Teacher:
“Time’s up. Let’s see how our little warriors survived.”
Everyone held their breath.
The teacher stared at the score sheet like he couldn’t believe his own eyes.
Teacher:
“…Toppo… got 13 out of 16?”
He rubbed his glasses, checked the paper again, then looked back at Toppo like he was seeing a UFO.
Teacher:
“…Did the history gods descend upon you or something?!”
The class gasped.
Random kid:
“NO WAY! TOPPO?! He probably cheated! There’s no other explanation!”
Toppo was frozen for half a second, then suddenly—
Toppo:
“…WE… ACTUALLY WON?!”
________________________________________
And then pure chaos.
Toppo grabbed Soras’s hands and started jumping up and down like he’d just won the lottery.
Toppo:
“HAHAHA!!! WE DID IT!!! I’M A GENIUS!!!”
He was laughing so loud the whole class was staring.
Soras just stood there stiff as a statue, being shaken like a ragdoll.
Soras:
“…Can you… not?”
But Toppo wasn’t listening.
Toppo (still spinning her):
“I’M NOT THE CLASS DUMBASS ANYMORE! HISTORY WILL REMEMBER THIS DAY!!!”
Crawos facepalmed so hard it echoed.
Crawos:
“Bro… you’re scaring her. And everyone else.”
________________________________________
Meanwhile, Chio was sitting at her desk, fists clenched, her pride shattered.
Chio (in her head):
She beat me… and with THAT idiot? No. No way. This isn’t over.
________________________________________
Finally, the teacher cleared his throat, still looking dazed.
Teacher:
“…Ahem. Anyway. Last place goes to…”
He checked the paper.
Teacher:
“…Kenta and Yuji. 4 out of 16. Congratulations, you two will handle cleaning the entire school!”
The same random kid who accused Toppo of cheating shot up from his seat.
Random kid (Kenta):
“WHAT?! NOOOO! THIS IS RIGGED! TOPPO SHOULD BE CLEANING, NOT ME!”
Teacher (smirking):
“Sorry, Kenta. Life’s unfair. Grab a broom.”
Toppo grinned like a villain, still holding his paper high.
Toppo:
“Looks like the real loser’s YOU, bro! Have fun cleaning~ 😎”
Kenta looked like he was about to cry while the whole class burst into laughter.
The bell rang, signaling the end of the day.
Students packed their bags, chatting excitedly as they left. Even Soras quietly gathered her things and headed toward the door.
Toppo watched her leave, still buzzing from his historic quiz victory.
Toppo (leaning close to Crawos):
“Bro… I bet she studies after school. That’s how she got all 16 questions right. She’s definitely hiding some secret study spot.”
Crawos raised an eyebrow.
Crawos:
“…So? What’s it to you?”
Toppo (whispering like it’s a top-secret mission):
“Bro… think about it. If we find out her secret… I can finally stop being a bottom-tier student!”
Crawos:
“…Or… you could just, you know, study normally?”
Toppo:
“Bro, who does that in 2025?”
Crawos stared at him in pure disappointment.
Crawos:
“You’re actually hopeless.”
But Toppo was already slinging his bag over his shoulder, determination written all over his face.
Toppo:
“Come on, let’s follow her. I bet she’s going somewhere mysterious.”
Crawos sighed but reluctantly followed.
Crawos:
“Fine. But when we get caught and she thinks you’re a creep, don’t drag me into your downfall.”
Toppo (grinning):
“Relax, bro. This is called academic research!”
Crawos muttered under his breath.
Crawos:
“More like academic stalking…”
And so, the two idiots trailed behind Soras at a safe distance as she walked home…
Soras walked quietly down the street, her bag hanging neatly on her shoulder. She didn’t look back once, but somehow her steps felt calculated.
Meanwhile, a few meters behind…
Toppo was crouching like a badly trained spy, pretending to blend in with a stiff, skinny tree. Crawos was just standing next to him, facepalming.
Crawos (whispering):
“Bro… this tree is literally thinner than you. Anyone can see you.”
Toppo (also whispering):
“Shut up, bro! I’m invisible!”
Crawos just stared at him like he’d lost it.
Suddenly—
Soras (without even turning):
“Come out, Toppo. I can see you.”
Toppo FROZE. His soul left his body.
Toppo:
“…She… she noticed?!” 😨
Soras finally turned around, her calm eyes locking straight onto him.
Soras:
“Why… are you following me?”
Toppo’s brain panicked. Think! THINK!
And then… he blurted out the dumbest thing possible.
Toppo:
“Uh—uhh… MY HOUSE! Yeah! My house is… uh… up there!”
He pointed vaguely at the direction she was walking.
Crawos blinked.
Crawos:
“Bro… your house is in the complete opposite direction.”
Toppo elbowed him hard before he could say more.
Toppo (laughing nervously):
“Y-Yeah, haha, I sometimes take the scenic route! Gotta… enjoy the fresh air, you know?”
Soras stared at him for two full seconds.
Soras:
“…Oh.”
And just like that, she turned back around and continued walking quietly, not even questioning it further.
Toppo just stood there awkwardly, pretending everything was fine.
They followed a bit longer until finally—
Soras stopped in front of a neat little house. Without saying a single word, she opened the door…
…and then SLAMMED IT HARD.
BAM!
Toppo flinched so hard he almost dropped his bag.
Toppo:
“…Did she just… slam the door on me?”
Crawos smirked.
Crawos:
“Congrats, bro. That’s the sound of her officially thinking you’re a weirdo.”
Toppo just stood there, staring blankly at the closed door.
Toppo:
“…I think I just lost all my dignity today.” 😭
Crawos patted his shoulder like he was comforting a fallen soldier.
Crawos:
“Yeah… you did. Anyway, time to lose some money. You owe me ice cream, remember?”
Toppo blinked, still dazed, then forced a weak smile.
Toppo:
“Oh, right… it’s on me… FOR MY VICTORY…”
Crawos chuckled softly, shaking his head.
Crawos:
“Yeah, yeah… keep calling it a victory, champ.”
And with that, they walked off toward the shop.
Later that evening…
Toppo lay on his bed, staring blankly at the ceiling, rolling his phone in his hand.
Toppo (in his head):
“Why did I even follow her…? What was I thinking? 😩”
He sighed deeply, remembering how calmly she caught him hiding behind the tree. And then, without warning, the memory of her soft hand in his during the quiz flashed in his mind.
Toppo (covering his face with a pillow):
“AAHHH, why am I thinking about that?! It wasn’t even a big deal!” 😖
Toppo tossed and turned on his bed, still overthinking.
Toppo (muttering):
“…Weird girl. Calm all the time, even during a quiz. And why does my brain keep replaying that hand thing?!” 😭
He rolled over, hugging his pillow dramatically.
Toppo (muttering again):
“If this keeps up… I’m actually gonna start… liking her.” 😳
He froze for a moment.
Then immediately sat up, slapped his cheeks, and yelled:
Toppo:
“NO WAY. SHE’S DEFINITELY SOME SECRET DICTATOR!” 😤
From the other room, Propeno’s voice boomed:
Propeno:
“SHUT UP AND SLEEP OR I’M THROWING YOU OUT!”
Toppo immediately flopped back down like a dead fish.
Toppo (defeated):
“…Life’s tough.” 🥲
And with that, he finally dozed off.
Meanwhile, at her house, Soras sat at her desk, books open, neatly studying. But as she tried to focus on the page, her mind wandered.
For a brief second, she remembered the way Toppo had grabbed her hand earlier in excitement.
She paused, staring blankly at her notebook.
Soras (quietly to herself):
“…He really is… crazy.”
